Just some general notes on Dark Pink before I dive into samples

--------------Dark Pink operations-------------
- Dark Pink is thought to have started operations as early as
mid-2021

- Targets entities in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries
  
- Targets military and government organizations to steal sensitive
information, including confidential data and intellectual property  
  
  
  
------------Dark Pink Techniques-------------
  
DLL Side-Loading:
 January 2023, the threat actors used ISO images to deliver
 KamiKakaBot, which was executed using a DLL side-loading technique

Evasion:
 Developers of KamiKakaBot employ various evasion techniques to remain undetected while executing
 malicious actions on infected devices. For example, they use Living-off-the-Land binaries (LOLBINs),
 such as MsBuild.exe, to run the KamiKakaBot malware on victims' devices
 
Stealer Functionality: 
 KamiKakaBot's primary function is to steal data stored in web browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and
 Firefox. This includes saved credentials, browsing history, and cookies.
 
C&C Communication:
 - Uses a telegram bot for c2
 
 - No IP's or any C&C IOC's yet


 Malware Delivery:
 
- KamiKakaBot is delivered via phishing emails that contain a malicious ISO
 
- The malicious ISO file contains a WinWord.exe which is legitimately signed by Microsoft, which is exploited for
 DLL side-loading technique
   
- The ISO file also contains a decoy Word document that has an XOR-encrypted section. The
   KamiKakaBot loader uses this section to decrypt the XOR-encrypted content from the decoy file then 
   writes the decrypted XML KamiKakaBot payload into the disk (C:\Windows\temp) and executes it via a
   living-off-the-land binary called MsBuild.exe 
   
- KamiKakaBot loader writes a registry key into
  HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell
