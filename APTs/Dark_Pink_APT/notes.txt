Just some general notes on Dark Pink before I dive into samples

    Dark Pink operations:
- Dark Pink is thought to have started operations as early as
mid-2021
  
- Targets military and government organizations to steal sensitive
information, including confidential data and intellectual property  
  
  
  
  Dark Pink Techniques:
  
  DLL Side-Loading:
January 2023, the threat actors used ISO images to deliver
KamiKakaBot, which was executed using a DLL side-loading technique

  Evasion:
Developers of KamiKakaBot employ various evasion techniques to remain undetected while executing
malicious actions on infected devices. For example, they use Living-off-the-Land binaries (LOLBINs),
such as MsBuild.exe, to run the KamiKakaBot malware on victims' devices
