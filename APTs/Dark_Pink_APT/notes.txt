Just some general notes on Dark Pink before I dive into samples

    Dark Pink operations:
- Dark Pink is thought to have started operations as early as
mid-2021
  
- Targets military and government organizations to steal sensitive
information, including confidential data and intellectual property  
  
  
  
  Dark Pink Techniques:
  
DLL Side-Loading:
 January 2023, the threat actors used ISO images to deliver
 KamiKakaBot, which was executed using a DLL side-loading technique

Evasion:
 Developers of KamiKakaBot employ various evasion techniques to remain undetected while executing
 malicious actions on infected devices. For example, they use Living-off-the-Land binaries (LOLBINs),
 such as MsBuild.exe, to run the KamiKakaBot malware on victims' devices


 Malware Delivery:
 
 - KamiKakaBot is delivered via phishing emails that contain a malicious ISO
 
 - The malicious ISO file contains a WinWord.exe which is legitimately signed by Microsoft, which is exploited for
   DLL side-loading technique
   
 - The ISO file also contains a decoy Word document that has an XOR-encrypted section. The
   KamiKakaBot loader uses this section to decrypt the XOR-encrypted
