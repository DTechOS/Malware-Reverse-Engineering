# Helper scripts to automate reverse engineering tasks

## API_Loader
This is an unfinished tool that enumerates the /Windows directory for any DLL files, loads them as a PE, grabs the exported functions, then runs a hashing alg against them. Used for resolving API Hashing in a Dridex sample.

## UD2_patch
this script defeats a simple anti disassembly technique and will patch any invalid UD2 instructions in an ELF executable, if the instructions are placed anywhere other than the main function, they will not get patched. This script was used for solving a CTF.
