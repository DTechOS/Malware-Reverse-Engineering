## The goal of this project is to re create functionality that I find interesting during malware triage.


### ApiLdr.cpp
This program is meant to (somewhat) emulate the API hashing and resolving functionality in a Dridex sample, so far it only locates DLL's using the Windows API's FindFIrstFileExW and FindNextFileW to enumerate the \Windows directory for DLL files and prints the results, later I will add LdrLoadDll and maybe a somewhat accurate API hashing and resolver function. Nothing will be exact, im mainly doing this to get used to c++ and the WinApi

Dridex Functionality from: https://blog.lexfo.fr/dridex-malware.html

```
- all the API names are obfuscated and as mentioned earlier, addresses are resolved without using the classical GetProcAddress. Instead,
  loaded libraries are parsed and functions names are enumerated from the PE export directory header until the CRC32 of the name XORed with a hard-coded key match:

- the loader checks if the module is loaded using the PEB and PEB_LDR_DATA structures

- it uses a combination of CRC32 and XOR with the same hard-coded key to check the module name. If the module is not loaded,
  it enumerates DLLs in the Windows directory using the GetSystemWow64DirectoryW and FindFirstFileExW/FindNextFileW APIs and loads it using LdrLoadDLL:
