# Manual Malware Emulation
The code in this repo are implmentations of techniques found in malware, to gain a better understanding of the code and how to recognize the actions in assembly. Not actual emulation.
## Dridex_enum:
Dridex_enum emulates the way Dridex enumerates the windows directory and uses LdrLoadDLL to load DLL's into memory.
